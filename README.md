# sims-ISCB2023
Simulations of two-level data sets that are analyzed by G-computation and IPTW estimators, combined with random effects models.

Steps to generate the simulated data sets are the following:

# Step 1: 
Import required libraries (file: libraries.R)

# Step 2: 
Import function expit() (file: expit.R)

# Step 3: 
Import function to simulate the independent covariates (file: cancerDataDesign.R)

# Step 4: 
Import functions to simulate the treatment and the potential outcomes (files SimulTreat.R \& SimulOut.R)

#
